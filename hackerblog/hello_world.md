# Hello, World!

Now you already know **3** programming languages:

* HTML
* shell scripting/commandline syntax
* Markdown

## Next up

Yes, what languages will you learn next? Probably one of those:

* CSS
* JavaScript
* Ruby
* ... or something else!

## What else can you do?

You can link to [places on the web](http://placekitten.com) and you can
also embed images:

![A kitten!](http://placekitten/400/200)

Mhh... you can also make stuff look like `code`:

    # here's some ruby:
    irb> 42.times { print "Odelay!" }
    Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!Odelay!=> 42

And of course you can make **bold**, *italic* and ***bold italic***
text. And headings. And other things.

Hello, Markdown!
