# Possibilities

Sorry, I have not really "fully" prepared anything today, but we do have
stuff left over and I do have some things. (Just not fully prepared
things. :)

## Testing the time machine

Does it work? Did you finish it? Try explaining why it is a time machine
and what your favourite time machine could do better. (And of course
trying to implement that time machine would be the best.)

More questions:

* counting:
    - `1..101`
    - `13..42`
    - `47..-8`
* working with [arrays](ttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Values,_variables,_and_literals#Array_literals)
    - put all those numbers you produced above into arrays

        ```
        var array = [];
        array.push(1); // => array == [1]

        array.push(2);
        array.push(21); // => array = [1, 2, 21]

        array[0]; // => 1
        array[1]; // => 2
        array[2]; // => ?
