- a snake
- more interesting shapes:
    - house
    - circle
    - ellipse
- something blinking
- plotted functions

are there other basic materials that could help? yes, there is
codecademy and coding math, but for javascript basics that are still
interesting somehow?

maybe also introduce 3d for those that are bored with the existing
stuff.

- debugging (would definitely be useful, prevent some problems)
- code sharing/inline editor
