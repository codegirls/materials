      <h2>Coding Adventures</h2>

      <p>Our most recent adventure has been into the realm of text
        adventure games.</p>

      <a href="https://github.com/codegirls/materials/blob/master/2014-05-20-coding-adventures.md">
        <img class="left" src="img/project-adventure.png" />
      </a>

      <p>After learning the basics of JavaScript, writing games surely
        must be the next step. So we just did that.</p>

      <p>Using three simple functions to tell players what happens to
        them, giving them choices and asking them questions we can
        already write small games, albeit without fancy graphics.
        (But you never know what's going to happen. :))</p>

      <p>After a few hours, our adventures already have some characters
        in them, ask questions and check if you're good at math. (Or if
        you also like giraffes.)</p>

      <p>If you'd like to write your own adventure, <a href="https://github.com/codegirls/materials/blob/master/2014-05-20-coding-adventures.md">
          you can try</a> as well.</p>

      <h2>JavaScript in small steps</h2>

      <p>Also know as: <em>Making Time Machines</em>.</p>

      <a href="https://github.com/codegirls/materials/blob/master/2014-03-25-javascript-steps.md#javascript-in-small-steps">
        <img class="right" src="img/project-timemachine.png" title="Not yet a time machine..." />
      </a>

      <p>To understand how variables, loops and functions work in
        JavaScript we wrote a series of small scripts that explain
        those concepts.</p>

      <p>For example, at first we simply counted up, then down,
        then we counted ages, not numbers, then we wrote the
        <code>happyBirthday</code> function and then we almost
        had our time machine.</p>

      <p>You can <a href="https://github.com/codegirls/materials/blob/master/2014-03-25-javascript-steps.md#javascript-in-small-steps">
          try it for yourself</a>.</p>

      <h2>pixl - Collaborative, programmatic drawings</h2>

      <a href="http://pixl.papill0n.org">
        <img class="left" style="margin-bottom: 1em;" src="img/project-pixl.png" title="So many pixls" />
      </a>

      <p>Originally thought as a fun christmas surprise, we had a
        lot of fun with <a href="http://pixl.papill0n.org">pixl</a>.</p>

      <p>In it we would use one simple function, <code>draw_pixl</code>,
        to draw squares on the screen.</p>

      <p>So, after playing around with it just before christmas, we went
        and drew all kinds of things: lots of lines, squares, diamonds,
        hearts and even some messages.</p>

      <p>And as a nice addition all of this is <em>collaborative</em>.
        That is, everything you draw is seen by everyone else.</p>

      <p>As always, the code and instructions are <a href="https://github.com/codegirls/materials/blob/master/2014-01-28-hello-javascript.md">
          online</a> and you're invited to try it out yourself.</p>

      <a href="http://pixl.papill0n.org/3"><img class="full" src="img/project-trixl.png" /></a>

      <p>(There's also a <a href="http://pixl.papill0n.org/3">3d version</a>
        of it, but we didn't play with it much, yet.)</p>

      <p>Playing around with the HTML Canvas element as a first
        introduction to JavaScript and combined with the ability
        to draw stuff</p>

      <p>There is a <a href="http://codegirls.github.io/materials/canvas_fun.html">live version</a>
        of it or you can <a href="https://github.com/codegirls/materials/blob/master/2013-09-24-canvas-fun.md">play around with it</a>
