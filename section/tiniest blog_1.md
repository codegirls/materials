## Goals

* Understanding the basic principles of the web
* Creating a complete website

## What is "The Web"?

### Websites

* Have an address (URL)
* Your browser downloads a website and displays it
* Actually just text (HTML-code)

```<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hallo, Web!</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
  </head>
  
  <body>
    <h1>Hallo, Web!</h1>
    <p>Webseiten bestehen eigentlich blo√ü aus Text wie diesem hier</p>
    <p>Man kann sich diesen Text auch von jeder Website anschauen</p>
    <p>Und das wichtigste: Links sehen <a href="../introduction.html"> so aus!</a></p>
  </body>
</html>```
[(Beispiel anschauen)] (../examples/01-structure.html)
* Are most times located on a server. You can also develop and save locally, but then nobody else can see your website.
