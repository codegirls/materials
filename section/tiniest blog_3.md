# More CSS

Coding with just HTML can get boring. That's why we'll need to know a thing or two about CSS. CSS makes everything shiny and pretty!

Out tutorial will continue with the following points:
* How do you transfer design ideas to CSS?
* Nice and clear navigation between pages
* *sticky* elements which don't scroll with the page
* Different style ideas for websites, e.g.
  - Classic blog
  - "tumblr" style blog
  - individual articles
* other applications:
  - Grids
  - gallerys with lightbox

And of course, as always, we are open for specific requests from you!

## CSS Basics

* Website elements are arranged in rectangles, so called *boxes*
* important attributes:
 - `position`
 - `margin`, `padding`
 - `width`, `max-width`
 - `border`


## How do you transfer your design ideas to CSS?

* Elements can be 
 - fixed, e.g. at the top of your navigation menu
 - adjusted to a grid
 - neither scroll upwards or downwards, i.e. stay 
* Pick one example, either one we suggested or choose your own and start experimenting!
* Tips
  - Working with sample or inspirational websites makes the process much easier. Rememeber: Nobody likes copycats, so       always refer to the original author
  - It's not a shame to look at cool tricks other people did on their websites
  - Sketch your draft really helps
  - Experiment live with size, color, font-size etc
