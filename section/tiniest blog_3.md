# A little bit of CSS

Coding with just HTML can get boring. That's why we'll need to know a thing or two about CSS. CSS makes everything shiny and pretty!

Out tutorial will continue with the following points:

* How do you transfer design ideas to CSS?
* Nice and clear navigation between pages
* *sticky* elements which don't scroll with the page
* Different style ideas for websites, e.g.
  - Classic blog
  - "tumblr" style blog
  - individual articles
* other applications:
  - Grids
  - gallerys with lightbox

And of course, as always, we are open for specific requests from you!

## CSS Basics

* Website elements are arranged in rectangles, so called *boxes*
* important attributes:
 - `position`
 - `margin`, `padding`
 - `width`, `max-width`
 - `border`

## How do you transfer your design ideas to CSS?

* Elements can be 
 - fixed, e.g. at the top of your navigation menu
 - adjusted to a grid
 - neither scroll upwards or downwards, i.e. stay 
* Pick one example, either one we suggested or choose your own and start experimenting!
* Tips
  - Working with sample or inspirational websites makes the process much easier. Rememeber: Nobody likes copycats, so       always refer to the original author
  - It's not a shame to look at cool tricks other people did on their websites
  - Sketch your draft really helps
  - Experiment live with size, color, font-size etc

## Navigation between pages

* fixed bar on the top of your page
* As an alternative you can fix your navigation bar a bit more downwards for a more "tumblry" style, e.g. after an image.

##Ready-made Styles

* Blogs [like here](http://heylu.github.io/web101/examples/pretty-blog.html)
* Tumblr style [like here](http://heylu.github.io/web101/examples/tumblry.html)
* Big Post [like here](http://heylu.github.io/web101/examples/article.html)

## Grids

* Placing elements next to each other is a little complicated.
* That is why use use so called *grids* .
* You can download a CSS grid [here](http://cobyism.com/gridism/)

    ```
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="unit whole red"><pre>gro√ü</pre></div>    
     </div>
    
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="unit half green"><pre>halb</pre></div>
        <div class="unit half orange"><pre>und halb</pre></div>
      </div>
    ```
