# A file is a file is a text: Introduction to working with text editors

To write cool and awesome code, you need tools. The most important tool is your text editor. A good text editor actually can take a lot of work off your hands. And best of all, it can help you reduce all these annoying errors in your code. So get ready for a whole lot of "texting"!

Structure: 

- What is a "file"?
- Plain Text vs.Code
- How to use your text editor?
  + What functions?
  + Tips 
- A little A to Z of files

## What is a file? 

Let's start with a simple question: What is a file? Let's brainstorm for a minute!
* Name different files 
  - Tip: To get you started, here are 3 file formats: mp3, jpg, html ....
* For which purposes do we use files?
* What do have all files in common?
* Can you think of typical file attributes?

#### Great! Let's recap:

* Files are a collection of data that belongs together.
* We need a program to open our file, e.g. a videoplayer, an editor or an image proccessing software. Which program we use depends on the file format. Sometimes we already recognize files on their ending: .doc, .mp3, .html
* Files exist beyond the run-time of a program. They save content for repeated use. 

## Plain text vs code

When you work with your text editor , there is gonna be a lot of text - obviously. But not all text you write in your .html file will be displayed as text.

For example

```
<div class="notplaintext" style="width="120px; top: 312px;"">
  <h1>Das ist Text</h1>
    <a><img src="/img/nottext.jpg" /></a>
      <p>The words written here are the only text I'll be able to see later.</p>
</div>
```

Most the words above are not text but code. We can't just "read" it. Instead we need a program to decipher it's meaning. And the code itself is not the information it just contains information.
The same does not apply for plain text. 

```
You can read this directly without decoding or translating it with a program. The test transfers the information directly to you. That's why we call it plain text
```

Code is a way of transfering data in a certain format. Text, on the other hand, does not need a special format.
