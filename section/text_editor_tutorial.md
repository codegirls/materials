## What is a file? 

Let's start with a simple question: What is a file? Let's brainstorm for a minute!
* Name different files 
  - Tip: To get you started, here are 3 file formats: mp3, jpg, html ....
* For which purposes do we use files?
* What do have all files in common?
* Can you think of typical file attributes?

#### Great! Let's recap:

* Files are a collection of data that belongs together.
* We need a program to open our file, e.g. a videoplayer, an editor or an image proccessing software. Which program we use depends on the file format. Sometimes we already recognize files on their ending: .doc, .mp3, .html
* Files exist beyond the run-time of a program
