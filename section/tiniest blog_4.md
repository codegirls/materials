# Publish

* Up to this point, everything we created was stored locally. But now it's time the world sees our work!
* Firsts things first: We need somebody who will *host* our website
* There are a lot of possibilites. Two examples are:
 - [Neocities] (https://neocities.org/), just upload all your code like HTML, CSS or any other language and it's online
 - [WordPress.com] (http://wordpress.com/), popular software especially for blogs. You can do a lot things with little effort and no knowledge of HTML, but creative freedom is restricted and the platform is financed through advertisements.
 
## Neocities

* Go to (https://neocities.org/) and create an account
* Upload your files
* Go to `http://nutzername.neocities.org/webseite.hmtl` -  look, it's your website!
* Send the link to your friends
* To update your neocities website, use the built-in editor oder upload the updated file 

## WordPress.com

* Focus on blogs but the CMS is flexible and also suitable for hosting other sorts of websites
* based on the [WordPress] (http://wordpress.org/) Software, which you can install on your own server
* You don't need HTML / CSS know-how
* Lots of [ready-made templates] (http://wordpress.org/themes/)
* Certain creative restrictions: Does not accept own HTML or CSS in the free version
* financed with advertisements (at least it seems to be discret with that)
* Has a lot of functions, some say: Too much
