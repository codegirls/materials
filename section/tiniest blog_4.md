# Publish

* Up to this point, everything we created was stored locally. But now it's time the world sees our work!
* Firsts things first: We need somebody who will *host* our website
* There are a lot of possibilites. Two examples are:
 - [Neocities] (https://neocities.org/), just upload all your code like HTML, CSS or any other language and it's online
 - [WordPress.com] (http://wordpress.com/), popular software especially for blogs. You can do a lot things with little effort and no knowledge of HTML, but creative freedom is restricted and the platform is financed through advertisements.
 
## Neocities

* Upload your files
* Go to `http://nutzername.neocities.org/webseite.hmtl` -  look, it's your website!
