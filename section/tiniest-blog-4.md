# Publish

* Up to this point, everything we created was stored locally. But now it's time the world sees our work!
* Firsts things first: We need somebody who will *host* our website
* There are a lot of possibilites. Two examples are:
    - [Neocities](https://neocities.org/), just upload all your code like HTML, CSS or any other language and it's online
    - [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/), popular software especially for blogs. You can do a lot things with little effort and no knowledge of HTML, but creative freedom is restricted and the platform is financed through advertisements.
 
## Neocities

* Go to <https://neocities.org> and create an account
* Upload your files
* Go to `http://nutzername.neocities.org/webseite.hmtl` - look, it's your website!
* Send the link to your friends
* To update your neocities website, use the built-in editor oder upload the updated file 

## WordPress.com

* Focus on blogs but the CMS is flexible and also suitable for hosting other sorts of websites
* based on the [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) Software, which you can install on your own server
* You don't need HTML / CSS know-how
* Lots of [ready-made templates](http://wordpress.org/themes/)
* Certain creative restrictions: Does not accept user written HTML or CSS in the free version
* financed with advertisements (at least it seems to be discret with that)
* Has a lot of functions, some say: Too much

## Tumblr

* Focus on minimal *micro* blogs
* Accepts your own HTML & CSS for templates. You don't have to build a new one from scratch. Instead you can choose an existing one and [adapt it](http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes).
* Can also be used for static pages. However not for single posts.

## Communication

So, now we have learned a great deal about HTML and CSS: What the code acutally does, how to write it and finally where to host our creations. There is one thing we haven't talked about so far: Communication. The use of HTML & CSS enables you to publish but not to communicate with your readers. What do we do to change that?

## Out there in the endless depths of the web exist a lot of different alternatives:

* [Disqus](http://disqus.com/), a forum. It works well, but advertisment display is possible
* [Muut](https://muut.com/), forum
* [Google Forms](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=wise&passive=1209600&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fcreate&followup=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fcreate&ltmpl=forms), forms e.g for surveys. Can also be used for non-public inquiries.
* Email, an evergreen
* [Facebook Pages](https://www.facebook.com/about/pages), wide range, very easy to reach people and you can combine it with blog posts, links etc. But it exlcudes everybody who does not have a facebook account and you influence on design
* Most blog platforms like wordpress or blogspot offer a built-in comment function which you can moderate and publish.
* Other ideas?
