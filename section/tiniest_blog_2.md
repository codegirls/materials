# More HTML

Just plain text can get a bit boring. But HTML can do so much more ...

## Images

* Images are marked with the `img`element

```
    <h1>
    Eine Katze!
    </h1>
    <img src="http://placekitten.com/400/400?image=9" />
```

*  HTML is a little bit more complicated because of:
  - self-closing elements `<... />`
  - attributes `src=".."`
